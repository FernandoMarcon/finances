# Introduction to Financial Markets

Financial institutions are a pillar of civilized society, directing resources across space and time to their best uses,
supporting and incentivizing people in their productive ventures, and managing the economic risks they take on. The workings
of these institutions are important to comprehend if we are to predict their actions today and their evolution in the
coming of information age.

# VaR
- "Value at risk"
- Invented after stock market crash of 1987
- Usually quoted in units of $ for a given probability and time horizon
- 1% one-year VaR of $10 million means 1% chance that a portfolio will lose $10 million in a year

# Stress Tests
- Originally, term referred to a medical procedure to test for cardiovascular fitness
- OFHEO started testing firms' ability to withstand economic crisis before the 2008 crisis, failed.
- Dodd Frank Act 2010 requires the Federal Reserve to do annual stress tests for nonbank financial institutions it supervises for at least three different economic scenarios.
- European Banking Authority, created 2011
- UK, China, etc.
- Critics of stress tests such as Anat Admati find them inadequate.

# S&P 500
- Used as a benchmark for return

# Beta
- The CAPM implies that the expected return on the ith asset Millennials, also known as Generation Y (or simply Gen Y), are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 being a widely accepted defining range for the generation.is determined from its beta
- Beta ($\beta_i$) is the regression slope coefficient when the return on the ith asset is regressed on the return on the market.
$$\beta_i = \frac{Cov (r_i, r_{market})}{Var (r_{market})}$$
where $r$ stands for _return_

# Market Risk versus Idiosyncratic risk
- By construction, the residuals or oerror terms in a regression are uncorrelated with the fitter or predicted value
- So, the variance of the return of a stock is equal to its beta squared times the variance of tyhe market return (systematic risk) plus the variance of the residual in the regression (idiosyncratic risk)

# Distributions and outliers
- In finance, things tends to not follow the normal distribution
- Normal vs. Cauchy (Fat-tailed) distributions

## Central Limit Theorem
- Averages of a large number of independent identically distributed shocks (whose variance is finite) are approximatelly normally distributed
- Can fail if the underlying shocks are fat tailed
- Can fail if the underlying shocks lose their independence

# Insurance
## Fundamental Insurance Principles and Issues
- __Risk Pooling__ is the source of all value in insurance
- If _n_ policies, each has independent probability _p_ of a claim, then the number of claims follows the binomial distribution. The standard deviation of the fraction of policies that result in a claim is
$$\sqrt{(1-p)/n}$$
- _Law of large numbers_: as _n_ gets large, standard deviation approaches zero.
- _Moral Hazards_ dealt with partially by deductions and co-insurance.
- _Selection Bias_ dealt with by group policies, by testing and referrals, and by mandatory government insurance.
## Radical Financial Innovation - Example I: Insurance
- Burial societies ancient Rome, true insurance policies appeared in Italy in 14th century
- Rapid development of actuarial theory starting in 1600s with notion of probability
- Morris Robinson Mutual Life of NY 1840: highly-paid salesmen (agency theory)
- Henry Hyde Equitable Life Assurance Society 1880s: large cash value (psychological framing)
- Viviana Zelizer: challenging God, tempting fate (psychological framing)
- Inventions copied around the world
- Life insurance is a relic, of a day when people died young

# Portfolio Management: An Alternative to Insurance
- Diversification of ownership
